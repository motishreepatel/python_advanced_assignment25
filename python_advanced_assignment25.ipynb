    "#Q1 - What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "The distinction between a NumPy array and a Pandas DataFrame lies in their underlying structures, functionality, and intended use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NumPy Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure: A NumPy array is a homogeneous, multidimensional container that stores elements of the same data type in a contiguous block \n",
    "of memory. It is optimized for numerical operations and supports n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- Functionality: NumPy provides powerful mathematical and numerical operations, broadcasting, slicing, and indexing capabilities for \n",
    "efficient manipulation and computation on arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure: A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure that can hold heterogeneous data types in columns. It is built on \n",
    "top of NumPy arrays and provides additional functionalities for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- Functionality: Pandas offers high-level data manipulation tools like indexing, grouping, reshaping, merging, and time series functionality. \n",
    "DataFrames allow easy handling of missing data, handling categorical variables, and handling labeled axes (rows and columns) with powerful \n",
    "data alignment capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion between NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames is straightforward and can be done using Pandas functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a NumPy array to a Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "#Exp:\n",

    "\n",
    "numpy_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "dataframe = pd.DataFrame(numpy_array)\n",

    "#Q2 - What can go wrong when an user enters in a stock-tickerÂ symbol, and how do you handle it?\n",
    "#answer:\n",
    "When a user enters a stock ticker symbol, there are several potential issues that can occur, and it's essential to handle them appropriately. \n",
    "Here are some common issues and ways to handle them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Invalid Ticker Symbol: \n",
    "The user may enter an invalid or nonexistent stock ticker symbol. This can happen due to typographical errors, \n",
    "outdated symbols, or symbols for companies that are no longer publicly traded. To handle this, you can implement error checking and \n",
    "validation mechanisms. For example, you can compare the entered symbol against a database or API to verify its validity before further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Incomplete or Ambiguous Ticker Symbol: \n",
    "The user may provide an incomplete or ambiguous stock ticker symbol, such as entering only a partial \n",
    "symbol or a symbol that matches multiple companies. In such cases, you can implement fuzzy matching algorithms or search strategies to find \n",
    "the closest matching ticker symbol or present a list of possible matches for the user to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Retrieval Errors: \n",
    "When fetching stock data, there can be errors related to network connectivity, server issues, or data source limitations. \n",
    "These errors may prevent you from retrieving the desired stock data. To handle this, you can implement error handling mechanisms, such as \n",
    "retries with backoff strategies or displaying appropriate error messages to the user."

    "#Q3 - Identify some of the plotting techniques that are used to produce a stock-market chart.\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "Several plotting techniques are commonly used to produce stock market charts. These techniques help visualize and analyze the price and \n",
    "volume movements of stocks over time. Here are some key plotting techniques used in stock market charts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line Chart: \n",
    "The line chart is a basic and widely used technique in stock market analysis. It plots the closing prices of stocks over time, connecting \n",
    "the data points with a line. Line charts provide a simple visualization of the trend in stock prices.\n",
    "\n",

    "Bar charts represent price movements using vertical bars. Each bar represents a specific time period and displays the opening, closing, high, \n",

    "#Q4 - Why is it essential to print a legend on a stock market chart?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "It is essential to print a legend on a stock market chart because it provides critical information about the data being presented, \n",
    "ensuring clarity and understanding for the viewer. Here are the reasons why including a legend is important in stock market charts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Interpretation: \n",
    "A legend helps interpret the information presented in the chart by associating different graphical elements with \n",
    "their corresponding meanings. It provides context and explains the representation of various lines, colors, or symbols used in the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Labels: \n",
    "In stock market charts, different lines or areas may represent various data series, such as different stocks, indices, or \n",
    "technical indicators. The legend displays the labels or names of these data series, making it easier to identify and differentiate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visual Guide: \n",
    "A legend acts as a visual guide that links the information in the chart to its significance. It helps viewers understand the \n",
    "relationship between colors, symbols, or patterns used in the chart and the data they represent. This ensures that viewers can accurately \n",
    "interpret the chart's information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cross-Referencing: \n",
    "Stock market charts often contain multiple lines or indicators that provide different insights into the market. \n",
    "A legend allows viewers to cross-reference the lines or indicators with their corresponding descriptions, enabling a comprehensive \n",
    "understanding of the chart's content."

    "#Answer:\n",
    "To limit the length of a Pandas DataFrame to less than a year, you can filter the DataFrame based on the desired time range. Assuming your \n",
    "DataFrame has a column representing the date or timestamp, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the column representing the date or timestamp to a Pandas Datetime type if it is not already in that format. This allows for \n",
    "convenient date-based filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the desired start and end dates to define the time range you want to limit the DataFrame to. For example, if you want to limit it to \n",
    "the past year, you can calculate the start date as today's date minus one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use boolean indexing to filter the DataFrame based on the desired time range. Create a boolean condition that checks if each date value \n",
    "falls within the specified range.\n",

    "4. Apply the boolean condition as a mask to the DataFrame to filter the rows that meet the condition, effectively limiting the DataFrame to \n",
